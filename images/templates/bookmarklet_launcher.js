//  Since the JavaScript code will be stored as a bookmark, we will not be able to update it after the user 
// has added it to their bookmarks bar. This is an important drawback that you can solve by implementing 
// a launcher script. Users will save the launcher script as a bookmark, and the launcher script will load 
// the actual JavaScript bookmarklet from a URL. By doing this, you will be able to update the code of the 
// bookmarklet at any time. This is the approach that we will take to build the bookmarklet. Letâ€™s start!
